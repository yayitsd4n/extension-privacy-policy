# Extension Privacy Policy

## Intro
Different extensions use data in different ways. This privacy policy encompasses the general principles of how extensions I write handle your data.

## Data Collection
None of the extensions that I have published collect or transmit data. This includes HTTP logging, usage information, or API use.
Any data that is used by an extension I publish stays local to the machine that it's being run from. Since no data is being collected,
it stands to reason that none of your data is being shared with third parties.

## Third-Party APIs
Currently, the only APIs being used by my extensions are ones that ship with the browser that the extension is being run on. Data specific APIs I use are IndexedDB and localStorage. These two APIs are used to store non-personal information local to the machine and are necessary for the extenstion to function. An example of this useage is saving a non-personal UID, scaped from a website that the extensions runs on, so that it can be referenced between page loads. This data is local to your machine and does not leave it.


## Changes to the Pricacy Policy
If there are substantial changes made to this privacy policy, I will publish a new version for the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the changes.
